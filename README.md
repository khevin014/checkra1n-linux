About: Live Linux distributions like Ubuntu (1.9GB), Fedora(1.8GB), Arch(635MB) and even Gentoo(347MB) are extremely bloated if you don't need to actually install an OS. This respin of Minimal Linux Live provides everything you need to run checkra1n for iOS/tvOS in under 50MB.

Requirements: 64bit CPU, USB Thumbdrive

Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (1.1MB)

Download [checkra1n-linux.iso](https://github.com/downthecrop/checkra1n-linux/releases) (44MB)

# Building from source

```
# Resolve build dependencies
sudo apt install wget make gawk gcc bc bison flex xorriso libelf-dev libssl-dev

# Build everything and produce ISO image.
./build_minimal_linux_live.sh
```

If you fail to install libssl-dev from the default Ubuntu repos (Ubuntu 18.04) you can use the libssl-dev_1.1.deb file which should resolve the version conflicts

```
# Install libssl-dev
sudo dpkg -i libssl-dev_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.5_amd64.deb
```

If you want to add/change files to the boot environment add them to `minimal_overlay/rootfs/`
